# Onboarding Components

This directory contains client-side components that drive the self-service onboarding funnel.

- `SelfServiceOnboarding.tsx` renders the multi-step registration, organization creation, plan selection, and invitation flow.
- `AcceptInvitation.tsx` allows invited teammates to register or sign in and accept organization invitations using their secure token.
- Tests live under `__tests__/` to keep regression coverage close to the UI logic.
