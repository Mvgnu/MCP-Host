# Ingestion Jobs Page

This page lists and manages data ingestion jobs that periodically fetch content
from external sources and store it in managed vector databases.

It demonstrates usage of `/api/ingestion-jobs` endpoints and integrates the
vector DB list so users can link jobs to a target database.
