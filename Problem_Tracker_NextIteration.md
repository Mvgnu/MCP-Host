# Problem_Tracker_NextIteration

- ID: BE-BUILD-001
  Status: DONE
  Task: Replace docker tag/push subprocess with Bollard operations and improve error handling/tests.
  Hypothesis: build.rs should use Bollard tag_image/push_image streaming output; errors should propagate to mark job failed; tests or feature-gated integration needed for registry branch.
  Log:
    - 2025-10-25 10:55:35 UTC: Initiated task after auditing backend/src/build.rs shell usage.
    - 2025-10-25 11:08:19 UTC: Completed Bollard registry integration with streaming logs, error propagation, and tests.
- ID: BE-BUILD-002
  Status: DONE
  Task: Harden Bollard registry push flow with telemetry, retries, and documentation.
  Hypothesis: Structured RegistryPushError propagation plus scoped telemetry and resilience tests will prevent silent registry failures.
  Log:
    - 2025-10-25 12:15:00 UTC: Began audit of backend/src/build.rs for registry telemetry and retry coverage gaps.
    - 2025-10-25 13:05:00 UTC: Added telemetry-rich retries, auth-expiry handling, runbook docs, and tests; cargo test passes.
- ID: BE-BUILD-003
  Status: DONE
  Task: Reconcile registry status metrics to capture Docker tag failures and expose consistent observability signals.
  Hypothesis: Recording tagging lifecycle events and emitting push_failed metrics for pre-stream failures will make operational dashboards align with runtime error propagation.
  Log:
    - 2025-10-26 09:05:00 UTC: Audited registry push metrics for gaps around Docker tag failures and cross-runtime status propagation.
    - 2025-10-26 10:00:00 UTC: Added tag_started/tag_succeeded metrics, unified push_failed emission, updated docs, and extended tests.
- ID: BE-BUILD-004
  Status: DONE
  Task: Harden registry telemetry consumers and guard regression paths for push failure metadata.
  Hypothesis: Aligning API/UI consumption of new tag_* and push_* metrics plus defensive tests will keep dashboards accurate during refactors.
  Log:
    - 2025-10-26 11:30:00 UTC: Surfaced tagging/push telemetry in server dashboard, added metric timeline, and expanded backend negative-path tests for retry/auth metadata.
    - 2025-10-27 08:45:00 UTC: Audited repo consumers (UI, metrics API) for tag/push schema alignment, documented payload contract, and added regression tests for all RegistryPushError variants including zero-retry and malformed remote detail cases.
    - 2025-10-28 09:20:00 UTC: Completed non-UI consumer audit (DB, REST, SSE), added broadcast regression test for enriched payloads, and documented coverage in README to close BE-BUILD-004.
- ID: BE-BUILD-005
  Status: DONE
  Task: Automate registry auth refresh handling and surface dedicated telemetry for refresh outcomes.
  Hypothesis: Retrying pushes after credential expiry without manual intervention will reduce operator toil while the new metrics expose refresh health to observability tools.
  Log:
    - 2025-10-29 09:05:00 UTC: Audited build.rs retry loop to map insertion points for credential refresh hooks and metric emission.
    - 2025-10-29 10:10:00 UTC: Implemented shared Docker client guard, auth-refresh callbacks, and extended push_retry telemetry with auth-refresh context plus README/runbook updates.
    - 2025-10-29 11:00:00 UTC: Added unit tests covering refresh success/failure flows and recorded new metrics contracts before closing the task.
