# Problem_Tracker_NextIteration

- ID: BE-BUILD-001
  Status: DONE
  Task: Replace docker tag/push subprocess with Bollard operations and improve error handling/tests.
  Hypothesis: build.rs should use Bollard tag_image/push_image streaming output; errors should propagate to mark job failed; tests or feature-gated integration needed for registry branch.
  Log:

    - 2025-10-25 11:08:19 UTC: Completed Bollard registry integration with streaming logs, error propagation, and tests.
