  Status: DONE
  Task: Replace docker tag/push subprocess with Bollard operations and improve error handling/tests.

- ID: BE-BUILD-009
  Status: DONE
  Task: Parallelize multi-architecture builds with cache reuse and manifest lifecycle pruning.

    - 2025-10-26 09:15:00 UTC: Wired build_from_git to capture git revision, manifest digests, and credential outcomes before writing run/platform rows; updated README with persistence contract.

- ID: BE-MKT-001
  Status: DONE
  Task: Convert persisted artifact runs into a live marketplace catalog API.
  Hypothesis: Querying build_artifact_runs/platforms with server metadata and health heuristics will let operators browse real inventory instead of static seed data while preserving tier filters.
  Log:
    - 2025-11-03 09:00:00 UTC: Initiated API design; audited marketplace.rs static implementation and artifact persistence schema to scope query/aggregation requirements.

- ID: BE-RUNTIME-001
  Status: DONE
  Task: Introduce a policy-driven runtime core that evaluates placement rules before container launch.
  Hypothesis: Centralizing runtime decisions with marketplace awareness and persistent audit logs enables promotion gates, backend selection, and lifecycle governance without duplicating logic across Docker/Kubernetes paths.
  Log:

- ID: BE-RUNTIME-002
  Status: DONE
  Task: Enforce runtime backend switching through policy decisions with pluggable executors (Docker, Kubernetes, VMs).
  Hypothesis: Abstracting backend executors behind the policy engine will allow operators to target alternate environments and codify placement fallbacks without modifying launch code.
  Log:
    - 2025-11-05 11:15:00 UTC: Created task to track backend abstraction work after initial policy integration landed.
    - 2025-11-06 14:40:00 UTC: Landed `RuntimeOrchestrator` with executor registry, capability-aware selection, migration 0022, and passing `cargo test` to close out pluggable backend enforcement.

- ID: BE-EVAL-002
  Status: PENDING
  Task: Bind evaluation runs to manifest digests and enforce policy gates before deployment.
  Hypothesis: Guaranteeing evaluations certify a specific digest/tier will let the policy engine require passing checks before a placement proceeds, preventing drift between tests and deployed artifacts.
  Log:
    - 2025-11-05 11:16:00 UTC: Added backlog item to extend evaluation schema and integrate with policy decision flow.

- ID: BE-LIFE-001
  Status: PENDING

  Hypothesis: Using persisted policy outcomes and marketplace tiers to coordinate promotions and rotations will replace ad-hoc scripts with governed workflows.
  Log:
    - 2025-11-05 11:17:00 UTC: Logged follow-up to design operator flows once policy engine signals and audit trails are in place.

- ID: BE-INTEL-001
  Status: PENDING
  Task: Layer anomaly scoring on the artifact ledger to influence policy thresholds.
  Hypothesis: Highlighting build latency spikes, credential churn, or missing architectures via scoring will let policy dynamically adjust promotions and evaluation requirements.
  Log:
    - 2025-11-05 11:18:00 UTC: Added backlog entry to explore rule-based or learned scoring feeding into runtime policy decisions.
